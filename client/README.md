# iTunes Search App

## Description
The iTunes Search App is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for content in the iTunes Store and manage a list of their favorite items. Built with React for the frontend and Express for the backend, this application interacts with the iTunes Search API to provide real-time search functionality.

## Features
- Search for various media types (music, movies, podcasts, audiobooks, etc.) in the iTunes Store.
- View search results and add/remove items from the favorites list.
- User-friendly interface with responsive design.
- Secure application using Helmet for enhanced security.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Axios, CSS
- **Backend**: Express, Axios, Helmet, CORS
- **API**: iTunes Search API

## Security

- The application uses [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) for enhanced security, helping to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- Currently, there are no API keys used in the application. If API keys are required in the future, they will be stored securely using environment variables and not hard-coded into the application.


## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
